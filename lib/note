YAML Convention
==============
> constist of two hash; layout and config
> layout mush have only one root node
> node format xtype[#id][.class1_class2] ie textfield#text-id.bold_italic
    > id and class format: xxxx-xxxx-xxxx using dashed to seperate words.
> if node value is hash or array (not root). It will generate extnodes according to
  their xtype wrapped by ExtJS container automatically.
> if node value is array of array. It will generate hbox layout to wrapper all
  the inner elements
  example of YAML array
  - 
    - nodeA
  -
    - nodeB
  or 
  - [ nodeA ]
  - [ nodeB ]
> The first class of grid is used as store name of itself.
> The inline config @{ :attr(value) } but priority is less than normal config.

Builder 
======
> The id which separate btw word by dash(-) of each element will tranform to title, name, ref, header:grid automatically
  but be able to override it by setting its config
  ex if set id: client-name
    the following is the attributes stem from the ID
    title: Client Name
    name: client_name
    ref: clientName   * this ref can use in event script like this.clientName
    header: Client Name
    ...

Features
========
  > grid@{ :selector([checkbox|checkboxs]) } # generate grid using checbox for row selector

unexpected error
===============
> id must be unique
> id MUST not be the same as instance method
> beware nested form tag
> reserve word for id ex. title add


TODO
====
  ok alias config attributes by component
  > check dup id ?
  > standard search form for grid
  > configurable generator i.e. left or right checkbox label
  > compositefield eliminated in case show in hbox
